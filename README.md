This is a simple realtime chat example that demonstrates how to setup a Socket.io server in React.js as an API route end-point.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo and `cd` into it

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## How it works

Open multiple browser windows and start a chat to see it in action.

## Caveats

This example doesn't run in a serverless environment.
A running server instance is still needed.
